	<h2>Work Experience (3 years 5 months)</h2>
	<h3>American Express India Pvt. Ltd.</h3>
	<h4>Assistant Manager (Data Science) - <em>August 2021 to present</em></h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Calculated customer spending and related trends across merchants to create <strong>spend linked features</strong> to incorporate them into offer ranking algorithm, thereby driving a <strong>lift of 7%-9% in mAP </strong>(Mean Average Precision) bringing in an <strong>incremental revenue of $7M</strong>, which has now been productionalised</li>
		<li><strong>Generated offer embeddings</strong> from textual metadata and used these embeddings as features replacing manually created meta features in the model, thereby <strong>automating the entire process</strong> as well as <strong>improving the performance of the model by up to 5%</strong></li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Business Analyst (Data Science) - <em>March 2019 to July 2021</em></h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Mining Customer Behaviour from Interest Graphs - Application of <strong>PyTorch BigGraph</strong> and <strong>Deep Graph Networks</strong> on customer-offer interest graphs to calculate customer behaviour vectors which were incorporated as features to make predictions on personalisation of offers, driving a <strong>lift in Gini of upto 10%</strong></li>
		<li>Offer Sequencing - <strong>Predicting offers with highest click probability</strong> based on user's past sequence of clicked offers using <strong>LSTM</strong>. Witnessed a <strong>lift of 3%-7% in KPIs</strong></li>
		<li>Hyperparameter Optimisation - Developed a new approach (using coordinate descent) to optimising hyper parameters of any algorithm that <strong>reduced the runtime by upto 40% for XGBoost and 45% for CatBoost</strong></li>
		<li>Analysed and reported multiple bugs in the teamâ€™s revenue calculation process that was used to make changes in the dashboard representing effective yield which in turn <strong>increased the yield by around $70k</strong> (unreported earlier)</li>
	</ul>
